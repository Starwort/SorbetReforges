Tweak weapon and accessory prefixes based on Sorbet Cafe's video, 'The Problem with Reforges' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBfoOkhV2vY)

- Overhauls weapon prefixes as detailed in that video (most positive prefixes rebalanced)
- Legendary, Unreal, and Mythical have a (configurable) reduced roll rate, and can be disabled entirely
- Two new crit chance accessory prefixes (Focused, +1% and Accurate, +3%)
- Melee speed prefixes (Wild and upgrades) have twice as much effect to counteract the bad scaling of melee speed
- Movement speed prefixes (Brisk and upgrades) now modify the same stats that Magiluminescence modifies
- Arcane now provides +15 mana, -3% mana cost; three other prefixes (Attuned, +5 mana, -1% mana cost; Ethereal, +10 mana, -2% mana cost; Spellbound, +20 mana, -4% mana cost) have been added alongside it
